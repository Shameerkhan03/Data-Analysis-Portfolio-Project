# Covid Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global **COVID-19 data** using SQL. Key tasks include:
- Analyzing cases, deaths, and vaccination data.
- Calculating death rates and infection percentages.
- Tracking vaccination progress globally and by region.
- Using advanced SQL techniques like CTEs and temporary tables for deeper insights.

## Key Tasks
1. **Analyzed COVID-19 cases and deaths** using metrics like `CovidDeathPercentage` and `InfectedPopulationPercent`.
2. **Examined vaccination trends** with rolling totals and percentage of population vaccinated.
3. **Used CTEs and temp tables** for complex calculations and data preparation.
4. **Generated global and date-wise summaries** for overall COVID-19 impact.

## Tools Used
- **SQL Server**
- **SQL Functions:** `ROW_NUMBER()`, `CASE`, `CTE`, `TEMP TABLES`, `MAX()`, `GROUP BY`
